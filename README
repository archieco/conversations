Conversations
=============

Always missed the nice conversation scope from jboss seam in rails development. This is a very lean implementation. 
Basically, the method, conversation, wraps session returning only the hash for the current conversation. This 
makes easy storing session data for request/response workflows that are more than a single page while continuing to 
allow multiple instances of those workflows in the same session.

Install
=======

git submodule add git://github.com/archieco/conversations.git vendor/plugins/conversations

Example
=======

class StuffController < ApplicationController

  conversation :start => :start, :end => :end

  def start
    conversation[:moo] = :foo
    conversation[:the_time] = Time.now
  end

  def end
    conversation[:moo] # => nil
  end

  def middle
    conversation[:moo] # => :foo
  end

end
